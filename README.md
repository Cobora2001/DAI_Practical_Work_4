## Introduction

### Description of the web application
Welcome to our film review application. We developed this project as part of the Internet Application Development course at HEIG-VD. The goal of this project was to create a web application that utilizes the HTTP protocol. The web application is defined by an application protocol interface (API) and will be deployed on a virtual machine, accessible over the internet via a domain name. Interaction with the application can be done through a web browser and/or a command line tool such as curl.

### Purpose and main features
The purpose of our application is to provide a platform for sharing personal opinions about movies.

Features of Our Application:
- Read Existing Movie Reviews: Browse through a collection of reviews for various films.
- Write Your Own Review: Share your thoughts and critique on any movie.
- Rate a Movie: Provide a rating for the films you've watched.
